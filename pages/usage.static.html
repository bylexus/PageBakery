<h2>Generate Static HTML Pages</h2>
<p>One of the main goals of The Page Bakery pages is the ability to generate an offline, static HTML version of the site. The <code>generate_static.php</code> script does this for you. Just call it with an output directory:
	<pre><code>php generate_static.php [output-dir]</code></pre>
	That's it.
</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong> the following things when writing your pages:
<ul>
	<li>All pages / subpages you want in your static version MUST be present in the <code>pages</code> configuration in <code>doc_config.php</code>. Only those pages are processed by
		the generator script.</li>
	<li>Don't use any Ajax-Requests to dynamically offer page functions: Those requests won't work in the offline version.</li>
</ul>
</p>
