The Page Bakery!
================

A very small PHP framework for creating simple pages for both online and static (offline) usage based on layout and content templates.

The Page Bakery's main goals are:
* Create small pages/sites with small effort
* Keep a global layout for all pages without copy/paste it
* Have the possibility to view the pages both online AND in a static offline version

In some more details, The Page Bakery's main features are:
* The Page Bakery create pages from a layout template and a content template file.
* Those pages can be displayed dynamically on a PHP-enabled web server.
* Those pages can ALSO be generated as static HTML version, independant of a server,
  well inter-linked and bundled with all needed files.
* Its main goal is to create small pages, e.g. Documentation pages, with
  the least possible effort both in creation and maintenance.
* Support for pages and sub-pages: Simple hierarchy structure
* If you decide to change the page's design, you only have to change the layout

This project is mainly grown out of the need of creating documentation HTML,
with the ability to use it as static offline version, but STILL keep the possibility
to just "create" the surrounding layout / design.

This information is updated soon, this is the initial commit.
